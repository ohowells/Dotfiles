# Dotfiles

Just wanted to share some dotfiles that I use.

My .bashrc has a custom made prompt that shows some status info for git and the current branch.
I have also included the .sh file for the git info. Which I got [here](https://github.com/git/git/blob/8976500cbbb13270398d3b3e07a17b8cc7bff43f/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh).
